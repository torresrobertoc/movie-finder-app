# Angular Movie Finder App

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Angular-based Movie Finder application demonstrates my skills in building scalable, modular, and maintainable Angular applications. The app allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API, view detailed information for each movie, and save favorites.

## ✅ Key Features

* **Real-time Movie Search:** Utilizes the OMDb API for dynamic movie search results.
* **Movie Details View:** Displays detailed movie information including title, year, poster, and plot.
* **Favorites Management:** Users can save favorite movies for easy access.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Angular 19:** Standalone components, services, and modules.
* **TypeScript:** Strongly typed code for better maintainability.
* **OMDb API:** For movie data retrieval.
* **Git & GitHub:** Version control and public repository.

## 📌 Project Structure

* **src/app/components:** Contains Angular components (movie-search, movie-detail, favorites).
* **src/app/services:** API service for interacting with the OMDb API.
* **src/app/models:** TypeScript models for movie data.
* **docs/browser:** Deployment directory for GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/torresrobertoc/movie-finder-app.git
   cd movie-finder-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
4. Open the app in your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:4200/
   ```

## 📌 Skills Demonstrated
